# Advent of Code 2022

My solutions for [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022)!

This year, I'm going to try doing the challenges in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) running in [bun](https://bun.sh/) to meet the following criteria:

- Native TypeScript Support (no transpiling)
- Fast Execution
- Low Overhead
- Access to NPM packages (sorry [deno](https://deno.land/))

My goal is to have each solution fully tested and fully typed.

## Getting Started

```sh
git clone https://github.com/scott-morris/advent-of-code-2022.git
bun install
```

## Downloading your inputs

```sh
TBD
```

## Running a challenge

```sh
bun run ./src/index.js
```

## Using the template

```sh
TBD
```
