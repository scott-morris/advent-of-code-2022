# 2022 Day 3
Whoops. Well, I still forgot to update the template. I've fixed it today. This is the first time in this exercise that I've had to modify the inputs differently for part 1 and 2.

### Thoughts / Stuff I've Learned:
* Instead of `xdescribe` and `xit` that were present in jasmine, Deno uses `describe.ignore` and `it.ignore`. I'll have to update the template with that to make my life easier.

### To Do Going Forward:
* Consider revisiting the functions in `helpers/parse.ts`. Perhaps separate the multiple-line work with something else.
