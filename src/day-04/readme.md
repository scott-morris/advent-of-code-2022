# 2022 Day 4
Unit tests and TDD save me more often than breakpoints / debug mode. Assuming that I write out my assumptions, these passing / failing tests do me so much more good than any `console.log()` functions I could inject.

I only wish that most "real world" programming problems came with such comprehensive and well-documented acceptance criteria.

### Thoughts / Stuff I've Learned:
* I still have a long way to go before I can document / describe my custom types the way I want them to be documented. Ideally, there is a lot more contextual information in the IDE.

### To Do Going Forward:
* Extend the parse functions to split out the lines and accept a regular expression to return values.
