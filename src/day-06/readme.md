# 2022 Day 6
This is the first challenge this year that hasn't required a `processInput()` function, so that's a nice shortcut. It seems that these last couple of challenges have been rewarding making the first solution extensible

### Thoughts / Stuff I've Learned:
* TBD

### To Do Going Forward:
* I'd like to implement something similar in the test cases as `test.each` as found in Jest.
** https://jestjs.io/docs/api#testeachtablename-fn-timeout
* There are lots of instances where I want to run the unit test on the list of examples given in the challenge, but I have to do much copy pasta to do it.
* Let's make something local and see if there's room to contribute.
