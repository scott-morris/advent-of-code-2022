# 2022 Day 7
This is the first of what promises to be many challenges that I don't get done on the day it's released. It took me a good while to be able to sit down and properly parse out the input to get to the structure that I was satisfied with.

Turns out there was a lot of stuff that I ended up building into this solution that wasn't entirely necessary. I guess that's the way it goes sometimes, but I still feel like it was a fun challenge to solve.

### Thoughts / Stuff I've Learned:
* I got stuck again with strong typing, especially when it came to writing the `get()` and `set()` functions which are intentionally flexible. I suppose I could have looked for a deno-compatible lodash / underscore library, but where's the fun in that?

### To Do Going Forward:
* I think I'm going to post on Mastodon whenever I get a challenge completed and the solution pushed to github.
