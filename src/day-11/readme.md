# 2022 Day 11
Ok, well this is the first challenge that I'm going to call a stop to while unfinished. I learned some cool things about JavaScript `BigInt` / `bigint` values, but it seems that even these are too big to handle. I assume that, since we don't really need to answer what the worry level is, and just count the number of evaluations each monkey does, there is a mathematical way to make sure that the items make it to the right monkey instead of using the given algorithm.

### Thoughts / Stuff I've Learned:
* Did you know that a group of monkeys is called a "troop" or a "barrel"?

### To Do Going Forward:
* Revisit this problem from a mathematical analysis to see if there's a better way.
